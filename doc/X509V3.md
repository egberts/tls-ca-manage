private: False

If X.509v3 basicConstraints extension with the cA boolean is set to true, then the certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates.

There are several types of PKI certificates used today:

* Web TLS
 * TLS server
 * TLS client, used in mutual TLS (mTLS) rarely
* Certificate Authority (CA)
 * Root CA
 * Intermediate CA
 * Crossover CA
* Code Signing
* Timestamping
* Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
* Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
* 

You can add X.509 extensions to a certificate at two different stages of the creation of PKI certification:

* When creating the Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
* When signing the certificate using the Root (or Intermediate) CA certificate
 * using `openssl ca`
 * using `openssl x509`


With the X509v3 extensions and its attributes detailed in [OpenSSL config file by section]({filename}openssl-conf-by-section.md), this article will assign them to each type of certificate:

Root CA
=======
Following the progression from top to bottom, Root CA is at the top.

Root CA requires the following X509v3 extensions:

```ini
basicConstraints=critical,CA:TRUE
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer
# if Root CA key is used to sign OCSP responses
keyUsage=critical,digitalSignature,keyCertSign,cRLSign
# if Root CA key is NOT being used to sign OCSP responses
#keyUsage=critical,keyCertSign,cRLSign
# absolutely no certificatePolicies here  (CAB BR-1.7.6 s7.1.6.2)
# absolutely no extKeyUsage here
```

Intermediate CA
================

Non-Leaf Intermediate CA
------------------------
Following the progression from top to bottom, Intermediate CA that does NOT serve certificates are called non-leaf Intermediate CA and is next in line.

```ini

# BC must be present
# BC must be marked `critical`
# `ca` field must be set TRUE
# pathLenConstraint may be present
# pathLen=0 if this is the last Intermediate CA; other non-zero if intCA is an intermediary
basicConstraints=critical,CA:TRUE,pathLen=0
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash

# AKI is required
# AKI must NOT be marked `critical`
# AKI must set keyid
# AKI may set issuer

# absolutely no certificatePolicies here  (CAB BR-1.7.6 s7.1.6.2)

# AIA should be present
# AIA should contain caIssuer or URI:
# AIA should contain OCSP or URI:
authorityInformationAccess=caIssuer,OCSP

# For Cross Certificates that share a Subject Distinguished Name and Subject Public
Key with a Root Certificate operated in accordance with these Requirements, this
extension MAY be present. 

If present for XCC, this extension SHOULD NOT be marked
critical. This extension MUST only contain usages for which the issuing CA has
verified the Cross Certificate is authorized to assert. This extension MAY contain
the anyExtendedKeyUsage [RFC5280] usage, if the Root Certificate(s) associated
1Non‚Äêcritical Name Constraints are an exception to RFC 5280 (4.2.1.10), however, they MAY be used until
the Name Constraints extension is supported by Application Software Suppliers whose software is used by
a substantial portion of Relying Parties worldwide.
