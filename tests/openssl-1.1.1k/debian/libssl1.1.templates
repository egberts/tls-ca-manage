_Description: Services to restart to make them use the new libraries:
 This release of OpenSSL fixes some security issues. Services will not
 use these fixes until they are restarted. Please note that restarting
 the SSH server (sshd) should not affect any existing connections.
 .
 Please check the list of detected services that need to be restarted
 and correct it, if needed. The services names must be identical to the
 initialization script names in /etc/init.d and separated by
 spaces. No services will be restarted if the list is empty.
 .
 Any service that later fails unexpectedly after this upgrade should
 be restarted. It is recommended to reboot this host to avoid any
 SSL-related trouble.
